# ðŸŒ± Plant Identification AI ðŸš€  

This project is an **AI-based plant and herb identifier** that recognizes different plant species using image classification. It also provides information on **plant benefits and care instructions.**  

## ðŸŒŸ Features  
âœ” **Upload an image** of a plant and get its name instantly.  
âœ” Provides **detailed information** about the plant (uses, benefits, care tips).  
âœ” Uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** for plant image recognition.  
âœ” **Pre-trained model on plant datasets** for high accuracy.  
âœ” Simple and user-friendly web interface (optional).  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Python, TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning model)  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)  
- **Flask/FastAPI** (for web API - optional)  
- **JavaScript & HTML/CSS** (for frontend - optional)
